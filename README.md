# LLVM developer Vim scripts.

Settings for the Vim editor to work on llvm *.ll and tablegen *.td files.

Make targets:
- `all`: to fetch the latest files from the [LLVM SVN](URL).
- `clean`: remove all files that can be downloaded from [LLVM SVN](URL).
- `distclean`: same as `clean`, but does not remove Vim configs.
- `install`: install configuration. TBD.
